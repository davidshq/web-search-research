## Disclaimer
This document does not indicate any support by Protocol Labs for this project. Rather it is a proposal hoped to secure their support.

## Time
This project has thus far been undertaken as a passion project on the side (nights/evenings). In order to move to a more productive stage in a timely manner it is necessary to commit significant additional time to the project. Protocol Labs could provide the necessary financial stipend to support full-time research for a period of 1 year.

## Connections
Protocol Labs has an established reputation as a producer of quality technological innovations. Being associated with Protocol Labs would open doors to collaboration with other individuals/entities. Not to mention the number of internal experts at Protocol Labs.

## Technology
Protocol Labs is currently incubating SourceCred which could be utilized to develop the Trust Network. In addition, the use of IPFS and Filecoin could significantly reduce eventual operational costs for the web search engine.

While the engine does not initially aim to be fully distributed, the use of libp2p as the project grows would allow for a fully distributed implementation to be accomplished.

Finally, IPLD and Multiformats are both a natural fit for the engine, especially as it encourage web developers to implement standards that support accurate indexing.
