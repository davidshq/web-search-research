# Proposed Solution to Problematic Search Results Quality

## Solution Part 1: Research and Publication
The endeavor to improve web scale search is impeded on several fronts:
1. There are not current, robust statistics on the quality of search results as provided by major web search engines (Google, Bing).
1. It is extremely difficult to measure the impact of poor quality results on actual human behavior in a quantifiable manner.
1. There are relatively few resources available explicitly and extensively addressing web scale search as this endeavor is restricted to a relatively small number of players.

Thus the first part of our endeavor would be to research and publish materials that would improve these significant deficiencies. This would include:

1. An analysis of several hundred top queried terms and the results returned by major engines.
1. Research on and a published proposal for measuring quantifiably the impact of poor search results on human behavior.
1. A robust report on the current state of web search and how to develop a web search engine provided in a centralized, technical, yet consumable manner.

We believe that even if the project should accomplish nothing beyond the publishing of these resources it would have brought significant value to the technical community.

## Solution Part 2: Implementation of a "Best of Web" Search Engine
Undertaking a full-scale web search engine is a massive endeavor. Before we embark on such an endeavor we want to demonstrate the usefulness of our implementation. This can be accomplished by creating a "Best of Web" Search Engine. This will allow us to test various aspects of our engine's capabilities (especially the Trust Network) without requiring us to work with quite as massive data sets.

3. Define your approach to addressing or solving the problem. 

a. Describe the steps you would take to reach a solution. Do not simply describe the end goal. Be technical. 
b. How would you derisk this research problem? What is the biggest obstacle to ensuring a successful project? For example, if your solution involves combining two technologies, explain how they would work together and what problems would likely need to be solved.
c. In relation to the problem you are describing, what would define a “successful” research project?
