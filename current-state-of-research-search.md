## Issues with Popularity As an Arbiter of Quality
- Ciampaglia, G.L., Nematzadeh, A., Menczer, F. et al. How algorithmic popularity bias hinders or promotes quality. Sci Rep 8, 15951 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34203-2 
    - Reviews some of the existing research on how the use of popularity in ranking algorithms can promote/hinder quality results. Suggests that by balancing quality and popularity one may be able to obtain better results.
    - Note: This relates to our concern that search engines tend to amplify existing content over new quality content. It does not necessarily provide a road forward as judging the quality of new content is quite difficult and often subjective. We believe that providing social incentive for discovery of new quality content while making relatively little known content readily available to users would result in a diversification of results and improvement of quality in top results.

## Use of Algorithmic Evaluation of Content Quality for Ranking
- Li Y., Ye Y., Xu W. (2020) A Meta-Search Engine Ranking Based on Webpage Information Quality Evaluation. In: Wang X., Zhang R., Lee YK., Sun L., Moon YS. (eds) Web and Big Data. APWeb-WAIM 2020. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 12318. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60290-1_46
    - The authors utilize algorithmic analysis of page quality by analyzing the title, abstract, and source of pages to produce what they consider better results.


[Note: Response to 2. "Discuss the existing research, listing the most relevant related work and key background readings. Be quantitative, and explain why the current or proposed solutions do not adequately address the problem. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your capacity as a researcher in the field.]
