## Disclaimer
Protocol Labs is not a supporter of this project. This is solely a document explaining why I believe Protocol Labs would derive benefit from supporting this research project.

## Protocol Labs Stated Purpose
"We aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through technology." - [About Protocol Labs][plpurpose].

There are a number of ways a new search engine could integrate with Protocol Lab's existing work which will be outlined briefly below. Apart from any existing Protocol Labs work, the web search engine standing on its own would significantly further Protocol Labs' stated purpose of making human existence magnitudes better through technology.

## FileCoin
The eventual goal of the search engine includes user controlled storage of their data. This could include FileCoin as an integration option and could provide an easy on-ramp for mainstream FileCoin users, individuals who might otherwise never have known of FileCoin.

## SourceCred
SourceCred may be a potential solution for the Trust Network implementation. Further research would be required as certain restrictions upon SourceCred may be problematic, e.g. the non-transferable nature of Cred.

In the Trust Network it is necessary to award "authority" for work done outside of the web search engine.

For example, proven expertise in a subject area may be reason to grant "trust" to an individual account apart from proven work within the context of the project (web search engine).

## IPFS
Integrating with an IPFS Gateway such as that provided by [Cloudflare][cfgateway] and making files/documents/sites on IPFS first-class citizens of a search index could significantly increase utilization of IPFS by mainstream audiences.
