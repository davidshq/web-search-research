# The Current Problematic State of Web Search

## Introduction
There are two massive entities behind popular English-speaking web search engines - Google and Microsoft. These companies can throw billions of dollars at their product. There are numerous international entities and smaller organizations attempting to improve web search. Is there really an issue with web search that needs to be solved?

This document attempts to outline some of the problematic areas of web search. Where possible figures/documentation are provided. However the resources available on this topic are not as profuse as is desirable. Part of the goal of this project would not only be the creation of a better web search engine but also the creation and dissemination of information and statistics on the problems of web search.

## Medical Query Results Quality Issues
One of the better documented areas when it comes to the quality (or lack thereof) of search results is in medicine. Below we've outlined a few articles and their findings.
- Kuenzel, U., Monga Sindeu, T., Schroth, S. et al. Evaluation of the Quality of Online Information for Patients with Rare Cancers: Thyroid Cancer. J Canc Educ 33, 960â€“966 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-017-1173-z
    - Finds that search results relating to thyroid cancer are of low quality. Noting, "Especially Google...focuses more on the dissemination of information than on quality aspects." (abstract)
- Cisu, T., Mingin, G., Baskin, L. An evaluation of the readability, quality, and accuracy of online health information regarding the treatment of hypospadias. J Pedi Urol 15, 40.e1-40.e6 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2018.08.020
    - Finds, unlike many, that the quality of results is acceptable though the literacy levels required to comprehend much of the best material is far above of that of many consumers.
- Arif, N., Ghezii, P. Quality of online information on breast cancer treatment options. The Brea 37, 6-12 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2017.10.004
    - Finds improved results over previous studies and that Google is now prioritizing non-profit organization results higher than professional results. Readability of results has also improved.
