# The Current Problematic State of Web Search

## Introduction
There are two massive entities behind popular English-speaking web search engines - Google and Microsoft. These companies can throw billions of dollars at their product. There are numerous international entities and smaller organizations attempting to improve web search. Is there really an issue with web search that needs to be solved?

This document attempts to outline some of the problematic areas of web search. Where possible figures/documentation are provided. However the resources available on this topic are not as profuse as is desirable. Part of the goal of this project would not only be the creation of a better web search engine but also the creation and dissemination of information and statistics on the problems of web search.


(Note: This document is in response to "1. Describe the current state of the problem. Use quantitative metrics to demonstrate the importance of solving it.)
