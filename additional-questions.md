3. Define your approach to addressing or solving the problem. 

a. Describe the steps you would take to reach a solution. Do not simply describe the end goal. Be technical. 
b. How would you derisk this research problem? What is the biggest obstacle to ensuring a successful project? For example, if your solution involves combining two technologies, explain how they would work together and what problems would likely need to be solved.
c. In relation to the problem you are describing, what would define a “successful” research project?  

4. What limits your ability to solve this problem without Protocol Labs? How do you see Protocol Labs supporting you in pursuit of this project? 

Please thoroughly define (qualitatively and quantitatively) your criteria for differentiating good vs. bad (or better vs. worse) search results.
How do you computationally evaluate the quality of links in a better way?
How do you show that this evaluation mechanism works?
What resources would you need to do this, and in what timescale?
In what ways is your "trust network" different from/similar to other reputation systems?
How would you address Sybil attacks?
