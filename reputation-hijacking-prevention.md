## Introduction
One of the primary challenges facing mediators of web content is the concerted attempts by various actors to manipulate the mediator's systems to their own advantage. The intensity and sophistication of these attacks only increase as the popularity of the mediator grows.

Various systems have been implemented to mitigate these attacks with varying levels of success. The current focus on major social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter shows the inherent difficulties involved in such systems and their as yet limited effectiveness.

In this document we will briefly address how we believe a trust network along with industry standard methods of mitigation can provide a significantly improved result for web search (and perhaps for other areas such as social networks).

## What Are Actors Attempting to Accomplish?
In order to mitigate an attack it is helpful to understand what the attacker is attempting to accomplish. In the case of mediator manipulation there are several common purposes:

### Financial Reward
Perhaps the most common inspiration for misbehavior is the pursuit of economic advantage. By manipulating the content a mediator offers and thus what is presented to it's viewers an actor can increase attention to its own products, services, or other methods of financial gain.

### Entertainment
Some actors are simply looking for a challenge, to get a laugh, to boost their reputation. They can manipulate the mediator to present humorous content or demonstrate the actor's technical skill.

### Political
Perhaps the most difficult to control are political attacks, often involving dissemination of disinformation. The end goal is to manipulate public opinion in favor of a political entity / nation / position. The difficulty in comparison to the other common purposes are:

1. Resources - Especially if a nation-state is involved, the resources can be nearly limitless. This is especially in contrast to those acting from an entertainment motive.
1. Motivation - Actors attempting to derive financial benefit require a fairly straight path from manipulation to reward. Each level of indirection (e.g. content that is not directly deriving financial reward but indirectly points towards the means of reward) increases the costs of the manipulation, eventually outweighing the potential reward. In contrast, a nation-state can shade content with disinformation which will net public opinion manipulation without levels of indirection.
